                    <p>My name is Elita I. Rexha. I was born on 14.01.2002 in Prishtina where I also live. I started my education in the elementary school "Hilmi Rakovica" in Prishtina.Then in the 9th grade I got transferred to Mehmet Akif College, where I finished high school.
                    During that time I have lived in Prizren because the school was located there. I spent very good years of education in that school because the level of learning that they used for me was just perfect.Then high school finished and I came back to live in Prishtina with my family.
                    This year I started university at Universum College in Computer Science Degree.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to job, I have not worked before because I have been going to school and studying all the time.But I can mention some experiences I have gone through.
                    Firstly I was part of the children's parliament in Kosovo, so it was a "small MP".
                    I got invited in many TV interviews.There was a competition "MacPro" organized by Mehmet Akif College where my "RaDrone" project took the Grand Prize and was nominated to participate in Genius Olympiad in USA.
                    Recently, me and some of my friends participated as a group in the "Nasa Space Apps" competition organized by ICK, where we also won first place with our project. It was really a great and hard project at the same time because it took a lot of effort to build the robot, put sensors, program ,set Artificial Intelligence... But for me it was a wonderful experience.</p>

                    <div class="text">Why a Computer Science Student?!</div>
                    <p>All students always have in their head the dilemma and the question that they asks theirselves:"What and where after high school?" So the preoccupation of what they will decide to study. Each student distinguishes a talent in a subject, respectively in a certain field, which they like and attract more.Of course as a student I also had these "symptoms".
                    The development of technology recently has been very rapid which has aroused my curiosity in this field. In addition to curiosity, I also had a kind of love and desire to enter the world of computer science. Therefore, this enthusiasm for computerization and seeing the market demand for staff of this profile, I did not find it so difficult to make the selection, for which I think I made the right selection.
                    I hope that with my commitment and with the help of the staff of Universum College I will not miss the successes and I will be convinced once again that I have made the right choice!</p>
